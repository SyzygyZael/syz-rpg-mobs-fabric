# ‚öîÔ∏è Mobs & Equipment!

This mod aims to liven up your Minecraft world! Rather than more monsters roaming at night, you will have to stay on your toes during daylight hours as well. Many different mobs of different hostiliies will be added. Each mob will have it's own unique quirk and/or ability. This mod is configureable.

This mod is a passion project and is very much still a work in progress!

# ü™≤ Known Issues & Prospective Updates

# üîé Important Info!

This mod will only be kept up-to-date on following Minecraft versions:
- 1.19.2
- 1.20.1
- 1.20.4

It may also be updated to only the most recent Minecraft releases, but as soon as a new release comes out, support for the previous Minecraft version will end.

My current priority is adding content to this mod, though I will try as best I can to quickly port to the stated versions.

**This mod will most likely not be ported to other mod loaders**
